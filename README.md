# Credit Fraud Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict fraudulent transactions based on a provided dataset.

## Features

- **Random Forest Classifier**: Used for its ability to handle imbalanced data and provide robust predictions.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Implemented for interactive visualization and user-friendly interface.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling of imbalanced data, feature scaling, and feature engineering.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate model performance.
